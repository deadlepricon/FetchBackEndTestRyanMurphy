Hi, 

Welcome to my Fetch back end test where I created some API Enpoints to Score Receipts.

I created this webservice using C#

if running on visual studio code, make sure you select 

"Run Project Assosiated with this file"

I have a built in API Tester called swagger that will auto open up a new webpage where you can manualy test the endpoints associated with the project

Please enjoy and i cant wait to hear back
